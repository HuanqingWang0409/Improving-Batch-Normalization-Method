# Improving Batch Normalization Method
▪	Improved two methods to simplify Batch Normalization and improve its trainability using **Python** and the **ResNet** architecture.<br />
▪	Adopted a new initialization of the parameters and introduced a convex combination of the batch’s own statistics and the parameters in the division step of Batch Normalization. <br />
▪	Reduced the train and test errors by **2%** using the CIFAR-10 data set and wrote a report.<br />
Remark: The Python implementation was modified from the Colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/d2l-ai/d2l-pytorch-colab/blob/master/chapter_convolutional-modern/batch-norm.ipynb that implements the original batch normalization method.
