# Improving Batch Normalization Method
▪	Simplified Batch Normalization and improved its trainability using **PyTorch**, **Tensorflow**, and the ResNet architecture. <br />
▪	Adopted a new initialization method of the parameters and introduced a convex combination of the batch’s own statistics and the parameters in the division step of Batch Normalization. <br />
▪	Reduced the train and test errors by **2%** using CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets and wrote a report. <br />
Remark: The Python implementation was modified from the Colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/d2l-ai/d2l-pytorch-colab/blob/master/chapter_convolutional-modern/batch-norm.ipynb that implements the original batch normalization method.
